# Examples

This folder contains two basic examples of how to use A-Connect in you Tensorflow/Keras models. A-Connect is only available for Fully-Connected Neural Networks (FCN) 
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). You can see an example for each type of neural network. You can play with every attribute of A-Connect, or parameter for training
the model. Every example shows you how we train the neural networks that we used to test our library and then how we obtain the results using the Monte Carlo method.
